# Facial Recognition 

# Overview

This project implements a facial recognition system using DeepFace and OpenCV. It is capable of recognizing and differentiating between new and returning users, offering a robust solution for identity verification and user management.
Requirements

    Python
    DeepFace: A lightweight facial recognition and facial attribute analysis framework.
    OpenCV: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.

# Installation of Dependencies

Before running the project, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

bash

pip install deepface
pip install opencv-python

# Implementation Details

    DeepFace: Utilized for the core facial recognition tasks. It offers functionalities for verifying if the person in the image is a new or a returning user.
    OpenCV: Used for preliminary image processing tasks such as loading, resizing, and formatting images.

# Usage

    Image Processing: Employ OpenCV for initial image processing tasks.
    Facial Recognition and Classification: Use DeepFace for recognizing faces. It categorizes faces as either new or returning users, facilitating user management in various applications.

# Example

The notebook includes examples where images are processed and analyzed using both OpenCV and DeepFace. It demonstrates how the system can identify and classify users based on their facial features.
Additional Notes

    Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
    Adjustments might be necessary depending on different use cases or image sources.
